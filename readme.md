# 🎉 LeetCode-SQL-50 🎉

Welcome to the **LeetCode-SQL-50** repository! This project documents my journey of solving one SQL problem from LeetCode every day for the next 50 days. 🚀

## 🌟 Introduction

This repository is dedicated to leveling up my SQL skills by tackling one SQL problem from LeetCode each day. The journey starts on `[start date]` and will continue for 50 consecutive days. Each solution will be documented and stored in this repository, along with the problem description and my approach to solving it. 💪

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
.
├── README.md
├── Day_1
│   ├── problem.md
│   ├── solution.sql
│   └── notes.md
├── Day_2
│   ├── problem.md
│   ├── solution.sql
│   └── notes.md
...
├── Day_50
    ├── problem.md
    ├── solution.sql
    └── notes.md
```

- Each day's folder contains:
  - `problem.md`: 📜 The problem statement from LeetCode.
  - `solution.sql`: 💾 My SQL solution to the problem.
  - `notes.md`: 📝 Any additional notes or explanations about the problem and the solution.

## 📈 Progress

| Day | Problem Title | Solution Link |
|-----|---------------|---------------|
| 1   | [Problem Title](link-to-leetcode-problem) | [Solution](Day_1/solution.sql) |
| 2   | [Problem Title](link-to-leetcode-problem) | [Solution](Day_2/solution.sql) |
| ... | ...           | ...           |
| 50  | [Problem Title](link-to-leetcode-problem) | [Solution](Day_50/solution.sql) |

## 🚀 Getting Started

To view the solutions, navigate to the corresponding day's folder and open the `solution.sql` file. For more context and understanding, check the `notes.md` file where I discuss my approach and thought process.

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run the SQL queries, you will need access to a SQL database. I recommend using:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite

Ensure that you have a basic understanding of SQL and how to execute SQL queries in your chosen database.

### 💡 Running the Solutions

1. Copy the content of the `solution.sql` file for the respective day.
2. Open your SQL database management tool.
3. Execute the query to see the results.
